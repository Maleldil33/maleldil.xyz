I spend the first 10 or so minutes of my day simply getting dressed, making my bed and tidying up the things left around my room from the day before. Empty cans, clothes I have left lying on the floor or on my chair sometimes for days. For the first several hours of being awake I enjoy the solitude and quietness of early mornings. I try to be as productive as I can, but I can’t always muster the energy to start working right away, so I spend much time reading, drinking coffee, going for a walks, chainsmoking, etc. Lately I’ve been reading ‘The shadow of the Torturer’ by Gene Wolfe, the first volume of ’the book of the new sun’. I usually read only a few pages a day but I think about and meditate on what I read throughout the day. I like to get my workout in in the AM, but I don’t always have the energy to do it as early as I would like. And early mornings are the only time I have to myself and I don’t want to spend all of that time away at the gym. Most of my days feel hazy. I often feel lethargic and I have this dibilitating brain fog that I can’t seem to shake, making it hard to think clearly about what I want to do during the day. I don’t know if it is due to adrenal fatigue from caffeine or the prolonged effects from drug withdrawals. I feel quite bored most of the time despite having quite a few tasks that I need to do with which I could occupy myself, I just struggle to do them.. Every day feels the same and they seem to drag on forever. Although somewhat parodixically time appears to pass by quickly when I think back to past events, probably because there are so few significant events in my life that serve as mental checkpoints. Right now I’m looking for an internship at a company as a software and/or system developer. I’m rather underskilled but I hope the internship will give me the motivation to become better. This is my first blog entry. I’m writing this as a journal to document my habits, my feelings and life situation. It is also my first serious attempt at journaling and I hope keeping this journal will improve my health, my mental clarity and teach me to preserve my ideas and bolster my writing skills. This has been my journal entry for the 14th of November 2022, I hope this journal will add significance to my days and make each day a little more memorable.\n",
